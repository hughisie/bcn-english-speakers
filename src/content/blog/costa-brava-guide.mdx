## Free Costa Brava Guide ⛱

This guide contains a run-down of **every single place** in the Costa Brava, from Blanes all the way up to France!

First of all, where and what is the **Costa Brava**?
The Costa Brava is the name given to the coast of Spain from Blanes all the way to the French border. Therefore, it includes all the coastal points in the province of Girona. In contrast, the area between Barcelona and Blanes is called the Costa del Maresme and should not be confused with the Costa Brava - in fact, we have a separate post about that, coming soon!

### Places you must see in the Costa Brava
While The Costa Brava isn't that far from Barcelona, some parts are more accessible than others, depending on how you plan to arrive. If you have a car, you can reach any place within about 2-3 hours from central Barcelona, depending on traffic.

### How to get to the Costa Brava from Barcelona
Travelling to the Costa Brava by public transport from Barcelona is a different story and you will only be able to take the train as far as [Blanes](/blog/costa-brava-blanes), Girona or Figueres, followed by an onward local bus to your destination. We recommend a coach from Barcelona to reach some of the key places and it departs from [Estación de Autobuses Barcelona Nord](https://barcelonanord.barcelona/es). The route is the number 1, operated by [Moventis Sarfa](https://compras.moventis.es/online/).
