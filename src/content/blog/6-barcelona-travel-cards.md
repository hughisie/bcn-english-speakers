You have a few options when it comes to using public transport in Barcelona - and the tickets available represent great value when compared to other major European cities. In this article, we will give you different options.

## T-Casual 

This is the one that is most common for infrequent travellers, the price at writing is €7.95 for zone 1. You can find the zone map here . The price is usually €xx, however, until 15th January there is a subsidy in the price to help people manage the challenges of inflation.

The card is good for 10 journeys across the Barcelona public transport network (trams, buses, trains, metro, and funicular @ Montuic is also included), and you have 75 mins between the first and last validation.

You can use it to get the train from the airport at T2 (there is a free shuttle in between terminals), and also the D20 bus which goes to both T2 and T1 from Placa Espanya (a little slower than the Aerobus (maybe 15 mins more) as it takes more stops, but more cost-effective if you are not in a rush).

Note that this is not valid for the metro to airport terminals 1 and 2.

## T-Usual 

This is a card which is valid for unlimited journeys in a 30-day period and at the time of writing this, the cost is €20 for one zone and must be presented (if asked) some form of national ID.
You can use this for the metro to the airport, which is useful as the tickets for this leg of the journey is around €5.20 single. I would recommend this for tourists who are spending a week or more in the city and want to get around along with getting to and from the airport using the metro (which is a bit slower than the Aerobus FYI).

## T-Familiar 

This is a multi-person ticket, valid for 8 journeys but the ticket can be shared amongst one or many people (scan your ticket at the machine and pass it to someone else to use). It is valid for 30 days but can not be used to get to the airport by metro (but can be used for the train that goes to T2 and the regular xx bus).

## T-Grup 

This is another card that can be shared and is valid for 70 journeys across 30 days and is not valid for the metro to the airport. At the time of writing it is €79.45 for 1 zone.
Other tickets are:

## J-Jove - This is for those under 25’s and will be retired by 01/03/23

## T-Dia - This is a one-day ticket that can be used on the airport metro and is an unlimited 1 zone card for €10.50

In addition to the regular travel cards, you also have the Hola Barcelona  cards, that are unlimited journeys across the travel network for 2/3/4/5 days. The airport metro is included and they can be brought online for the following prices (these prices are correct as of the date this was published):

| No. Days | Price  |
| :------- | :----- |
| 2 Days   | €16.40 |
| 3 Days   | €23.80 |
| 4 Days   | €31    |
| 5 Days   | €38.20 |


Personally, I think you are going to be better with one of the other options instead of the Hola Barcelona, but each to their own.
