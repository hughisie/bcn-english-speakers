A ‚ÄúCal√ßotada‚Äù is a Catalan tradition, where people get together and eat ‚Äú**cal√ßots**‚Äù. If you live in Catalunya and you've not heard of a cal√ßot then it's possible that you have not yet completed your 'Catalan onboarding'!

During the winter months between about December to early March, the cal√ßot season is in full swing and the idea is to enjoy this very Catalan tradition with a large group of friends in a rustic restaurant, usually in the countryside, where you will be mainly eating cal√ßots, bread and char-grilled meats, such as butifarra, morcilla, chicken and a selection of grilled beef or lamb cuts.

That being said, the main focus is usually on the cal√ßots, which are best accompanied with a special Romesco sauce, which is an almond and roasted red pepper sauce

<div class="info">
**Cal√ßots are a type of green onion** and look like big spring onions or small leeks, but are indeed a different variety in their own right.
They are grown using a special method, where soil is used to cover the bulbous part of the onion as it grows, forcing the vegetable to sprout up, giving the cal√ßot its unique appearance and ultimately its flavour.

## 2. Cal√ßots - cook your own, near to Barcelona

There are a few places where you can cook your own calcots near to Barcelona, but we have chosen our 2 favourite spots, which are both relatively close to Barcelona and accessible by public transport.


**Cal√ßots @ Font de Les Planes**, Les Planes. [üîó Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fontdelesplanes/)

![Font Les Planes](../../assets/blog/32-calcots/les-planes.jpg)

**How to arrive, by public transport:**

Take the train (S1 or S2 train, not the metro) from Pla√ßa de Catalunya to Les Planes station direct (20 mins, T-Casual zone 1 works, since Les Planes is the last station in zone 1).
From the train station, walk over the bridge and down the road to the restaurant (5 mins walk).


**By car:**

We'll leave the directions up to you, but if you do come by car then there's a car park, but don't arrive too late or you might struggle to get a space!


The place has fixed BBQs and tables for diners who are using the BBQs outside, with the metal cooking grill available to hire. You can also buy BBQ coal and wood (no booking, but first come first served). This is available at the booth when you check-in. Note: BBQ coal is approximately ‚Ç¨5 a bag (updated 2023) and the firewood is a fair price, but all paid in cash (no cards!). You will need to pay a cash deposit for metal grill rental. Note: you will need to take everything else, such as all the food you're going to eat, all cooking equipment, plates etc.

<div class="warning">

There is also a large restaurant at the venue, but it's recommended to make a booking by phone in advance.

![Europa Barbacoa](../../assets/blog/32-calcots/europa-bbq-field.jpg)

Europa Barbacoa is a very popular spot and you can go and cook your own cal√ßots, or whatever you like on the many BBQs that they have.


**How to arrive, by public transport:**

Example route from Pla√ßa de Catalunya - https://maps.app.goo.gl/GArNPkcKVtA3s8WTA 
- Take the L95 bus from Rda. Universitat - Pla√ßa Catalunya to Av. Europa - Vandell√≤s (T-Casual ticket, Zone 1 valid).
- The bus passes by Pla√ßa d'Espanya, so you can also jump on at any stop along the route.
- The journey time is about 45 minutes and the bus stops right outside the entrance to the space.


<div class="warning">
**Note**: You can hire chairs, which are usually ‚Ç¨1 each. Tables are ‚Ç¨4 each. Also coal and firewood is available to buy. There's also a big restaurant on the site, separate to the BBQ area, but the main attraction is the BBQ field. There's lots of space and you can just set up with a group wherever you like and the BBQ area is in the middle of the field.

Be sure to pay a visit to **Castell de Burriac** if you're in the area. It requires a fair amount of uphill walking, but well worth the visit!
