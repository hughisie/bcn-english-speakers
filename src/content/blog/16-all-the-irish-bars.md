<p style="text-align: center;font-style:oblique;">(in no particular order)</p>

## Michael Collins

The Michael Collins is worth the trip up to the Sagrada Familia neighbourhood. While it‚Äôs not super central, you‚Äôll still find that it gets busy most nights and they play host to live music, especially at the weekends. One thing we like about this pub is that it also attracts the locals, so you will find a mix of clientele. If you‚Äôre planning to visit Sagrada Familia, then it‚Äôs worth popping in for a pint. We recommend the Fish & Chips, but bring an empty stomach!

Address: Pla√ßa Sagrada Fam√≠lia, 4, 08013 Barcelona

## Dunne‚Äôs

Another well-located Irish bar (and in my opinion very underrated) is Dunne‚Äôs on Via Laietana. It usually plays refuge to those visiting El Gotico and El Born areas and The Cathedral. The clientele is varied and it can be anything from empty to busy, depending on the time of day and local events. They also play major sporting events, such as the football on one of their many screens.

Address: Via Laietana, 19, 08003 Barcelona

## George Payne

The George Payne Irish Pub is the go-to location for people wanting to watch the football. Being in the centre of Barcelona, it is a more busy and serious establishment, usually playing residence to large groups, stag and hen parties and generally serious drinkers. The George Payne is usually busiest during sporting events, so avoid these if you just want a quiet pint!
Address: Pl. d'Urquinaona, 5, 08010 Barcelona

## Flaherty‚Äôs Irish Pub

Flaherty‚Äôs is another secluded pub and lesser-known, since it is located in a quiet square just of Las Ramblas main strip. You will find all the pub classics from Irish Breakfasts, to Fish & Chips and Pies, not to mention a decent pint of Guinness!

Address: 

## The Old Irish Pub (Ramblas)

The Old Irish Pub on Las Ramblas is a solid boozer usually with serious drinking going on - tourists mainly - and is a large space inside. They usually have a good drink selection, food available and even live music on some nights (check the Old Irish Pub Barcelona website for events). If you‚Äôre looking for straight up drinking action then this place is for you.

Address: 

## Bloomsday Irish Pub (Ramblas)

The ‚ÄúBloomsday‚Äù, in contrast to the Old Irish Pub just up the road, is a bit more chilled out, although things can change in tourist peak season and at the weekends. The inside decor also feels familiar and similar to that of the Michael Collins pub up at Sagrada Familia. Not the cheapest pub out of them all, due to the fact that it‚Äôs on Las Ramblas, but it will certainly keep you hydrated if you pay them a visit!

Address: 


## Irish Pub Temple Bar, My Bar & Lennox The Pub

Here we have 3 pubs, but all within a stones‚Äô throw of one another, situated near Pla√ßa Reial on Carrer de Ferran. While being close, they are all very different - My Bar is the smallest and the other 2 are larger. The clientele are usually tourists, due to the proximity to La Rambla.

Address: 

## O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs (C/Ferran)

Just up the road from the 3 bars above, you will come across O‚ÄôHara‚Äôs Irish Pub‚Ä¶more.

Address: 

## Cheers (Liceu)

To do

Address: 

## Travellers Nest Bar

Nested in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, you will find this bar. It has been around for years, but in recent times has fallen below par (in our opinion) but still gets a mention in our exhaustive list! One saving grace is that it is open relatively late and could be a quieter option if you‚Äôre in the area but not wanting to go to a club!

Address: 

## McCarthy‚Äôs Bar (Via Laietana)

McCarthy‚Äôs is a bit smaller than others in the area, but it still packs a punch on major sporting nights due to its intimate atmosphere. The space itself is a narrow but long pub and the seats at the back can be a strategic place to hide out if you can get there early enough. Also, the bar staff like a bit of banter and are pretty friendly (much like most Irish pubs) and it‚Äôs good that you can get a decent pint so close to the centre.

Address: 

## The Black Horse

One of the great selling points of this pub is the cool, laid back terrace where you can enjoy a casual pint in the heart of the El Born neighbourhood. The clientele can be a bit mixed and you‚Äôll probably be among tourists while there, but worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area. As far as we know they don‚Äôt tend to show major sporting events but legend has it they put on a pub quiz every Sunday, if that‚Äôs your thing.

Address: 

## The Bullman

Also popular for its pub quiz (Wednesdays, although check beforehand) you will be able to get a solid pint and pub grub at The Bullman. The menu isn‚Äôt very extensive in our experience, but it‚Äôs not a huge pub to be fair. The location can certainly be handy if you happen to be in the area of El Raval/Sant Antoni and if you‚Äôre hopping from place to place, consider including it in your route.

Address: 

## The Shamrock

For the area of El Raval, The Shamrock is up there with the best. The ambience and clientele are generally more inline with what you expect from a decent Irish pub and there‚Äôs never a boring moment. Plus, it‚Äôs been there for years so it‚Äôs well established. During the day and evening you can sit on their terrace and of course they do pub food, too.

Address: 

## The Quiet Man (Raval)

To do

## Obama (Rambla de Catalunya)

To do


## Scobies Irish Pub

With Scobies you already begin to notice that you‚Äôre no longer in the Barcelona Old Town and instead you‚Äôve ventured into the Eixample neighbourhood. If you want a bit of a break from shopping it‚Äôs worth a visit and this pub is often unknown to a lot of locals, in our experience. Still, the Guinness is solid.

## The James Joyce

The James Joyce is the last stop on your pubcrawl when going out in that direction from the centre towards The Michael Collins. They often have a laid back atmosphere and they even have a few seats outside, which are often available, even at night. Maybe not the most famous Irish pub in Barcelona but it never fails.

## Lennox The Pub - Palau

The Lennox gets extra points for being well-situated for those doing walking tours of Barcelona‚Äôs Old Town and El Born in particular. The outdoor terrace can be fairly handy and in which case it is usually table service outside. On the flip side, sometimes the traffic can be bothersome if a quiet pint is what you‚Äôre after, but the somewhat dark inside will more than do the job. It can sometimes get a bit touristy and they‚Äôre not well-known for food, but with Honest Greens and several other decent restaurants being just a stone‚Äôs throw away, this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

## The Fastnet Pub (Barceloneta)

The Fastnet is generally more popular with tourists with it being in the Barceloneta neighbourhood. It offers a relaxed pub atmosphere, which can be a nice contrast to the other different bars and restaurants of the area as most are tapas, fish restaurants and grill places. Having said that, in the summer you‚Äôll find it very lively, but chilled out at the same time. Spoken English will go a long way in this pub and you‚Äôll immediately feel at home!

Address: Pg. de Joan de Borb√≥, 22, 08003 Barcelona

## Green Room

The Rambla of Poblenou wouldn‚Äôt be complete without an Irish bar! They do most of the pub classics, such as fish & chips and most of the time it‚Äôs table service, which you don‚Äôt always get at the other Irish pubs. They also have a large terrace so if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get a seat you‚Äôll be able to watch the world go by. Maybe a tad more expensive than the others, but still generally affordable. If you‚Äôve just come back from a hard day at Bogatell beach and you‚Äôre walking down the Rambla of Poblenou, be sure to check it out!

## Flann O‚Äôbrien (Diagonal)

To do

## The City Tavern (f.k.a. Beer City Irish Pub)

A personal favourite and one of the best places to watch the football sat down in comfort. Not so many know about this tavern, probably due to it being so far out the centre, but for locals it‚Äôs still easily within reach, being a short walk from Diagonal metro. You‚Äôll want to book a table beforehand if football‚Äôs what you intend to see, but once you get there it‚Äôs usually food and drink with table service.
