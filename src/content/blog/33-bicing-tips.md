## Things to know about Bicing

Most people enjoy free mechanical bikes or an electric bike, which costs 0,35 cents per trip (up to 30 minutes). The price then goes up - see website for details.

When you drop a bike off, you have to wait 10 minutes before you can take the next one

If the bike you take isn’t working, you can immediately put it back and take a new one, within a 3 minute window.

If the station is full, you can request an additional 10 minutes at the Bicing computer terminal at the station.




## Bicing tips & tricks
- If the stand is full, you can get extra time (10 mins)
- You can change the bike within first 3 minutes if it’s bad (but not for another type). You can also change it more than once
- You can report a bike as faulty on the terminal
- You can use Smou app and QR codes
- Usually a Bicing is faster than a metro
- It’s possible to go from Poble Nou to Santa Coloma in less than 30 mins!
- The JoTambe app has a scoring game for Bicing enthusiasts - some stations have an incentive to take bikes out at certain times 
- Always check before you ride: flat tires, brakes are working. Handle bars and grips are good. It doesn’t hurt to give the wheel a kick!
- Make sure that you hear the green light and sound when you check the bike back in
- Use City Mapper bikes section for faster access to station availability 
- You can reserve a bike and you have 5 minutes. The reserved bike will be flashing yellow on the panel but you can take out any bike. Red light means out of service. 
- Some AR codes are damaged so use your card
- You cannot bike share - inspectors are at Arc
-  Check electric power bars before riding


## Bicing extreme tips!

- If you take out a bike, you have a 3 minute window where you can choose to check it back in and remove another one. This is in case you wish to change the bike (maybe the breaks are not working or the electric motor isn't working etc...). You can even check the second bike back in and take out a third. Each time you do this, the checkout time will restarts. Note: you cannot checkout mechanic bike and then swap it for an electric bike and vice-versa using this method, so don't get caught out!

## Opinionated tips from a regular Bicing user on how to best use Bicing

> Note, these are very extreme, but if you follow this list you will have Bicing happiness!

1. First, check to see if the bike has a flat tire - it's amazing how many people check out the only electric bike thinking how lucky they were only to discover that the tire is flat, then they have to go to another station and wait 10 minutes (is this true?)!
2. Check to make sure that the QR code is scannable/readable (if you are using the Smou App). A lot of people only use the app and don't carry their Bicing card. If the QR isn't scannable because it has been defaced or broken, you can still manually type in the bike code (like a 10 digit alphanumeric code) provided it is legible.
3. Check to make sure that the breaks are working. It's surprising how often the back breaks don't work, or are nearly ineffective. You can do this by lifting the bike up in the dock, spinning the wheel and testing the break!
4. If you are intending to check out an electric bike, it is usually the case that the newer bikes are slightly better, in terms of performance. You can tell this by the handlebars, which will be contoured plastic grips instead of the rubber which comes off in your hands! Also, the seat can usually go a bit higher on these bikes.
5. Next, if you intend to take out an electric bike, it's always better to go to a station where there's more than 1 electric bike available, so consider walking to the next station if this is not the case.
