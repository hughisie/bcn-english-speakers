## Visiting Platja d'Aro

Right next door to S'Agaró sits Platja d'Aro. Platja d'Aro is very popular with tourists most of the year and it has a long beachfront of about 30 minutes walking end-to-end. Running nearly parallel to the beach you'll find the main highstreet about 4 or 5 blocks in and also the coach station - [Estació d'autobusos Platja d'Aro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xigzW68dsUudfYd98) if you're arriving from Barcelona by coach. You'll be dropped off more or less a 15 minute walk away from the centre, but a short walk down Avinguda de s'Agaró takes you right into the action.

As for the beach, it tends to get busy in summer and similarly do the many bars and restaurants right next to the beach, where you will find extensive tapas menus, classic Catalan dishes, fish & seafood, burger bars and cocktails. There's also high-rise hotels and apartments right on the front, for the more up-market stays.

For dinner in the warmer months, you'll want to head toward [Av. del Cavall Bernat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zUdybeUriECSnzDV6) street, which is a few blocks in from the end of the beach, where you will find many Mediterranean, Catalan and fish restaurants with terraces, most of which will be in full swing by 10pm. Failing that, anywhere along the same street back towards town and you will again find many many restaurants, from sushi all-you-can-eat to fast food and burger bars.

For those visiting the _calas_ (coves), the best route is to walk from the north part of Platja d'Aro beach all the way to Sant Antoni de Calonge, taking in the beautiful hidden beaches, such as Cala Rovira, Cala Sa Cova, Cala del Pi and Platja de Belladona. It's a 2-3 hour round trip if you do the whole thing, depending on your pace. One recommendation is to stop at the beach bar “Xiringuito Cala Cap Roig”, although it can be impossible to get a table in peak times, but they might do takeaway beers! You'll also want to venture up to [Park Hotel San Jorge](https://goo.gl/maps/1ZJYa6otwzE4A4KNA) for a beer/coffee, or just simply to enjoy the view. Right when you set out to do the route, you'll immediately notice the beautiful [Hotel Costa Brava](https://goo.gl/maps/SSxzovs4ztsggq6QA), which offers meals if you pop in and book beforehand.
