## About the castle

Montju√Øc Castle is a great place to go with the family for a short day trip in Barcelona, even if you don‚Äôt pay to go in. The view from the castle and surrounding walls offers stunning near-360 degree panoramas. On a clear day, you‚Äôll feel like you are on top of the world, with an excellent view of Barcelona and the sea. How you approach the castle and Montju√Øc in general is up to you, but <a href="#how-to-get-to-the-castle-of-montju√Øc">below are our recommended options</a>.

### Inside the castle

When you enter the castle, you‚Äôll come to the reception area where you can buy tickets. As of 2024, the entrance is ‚Ç¨5 per person (with discounts available for over 65s, families, etc, so ask inside for terms).

As well as granting you access to the castle itself and the highest viewpoints, there are a number of exhibition rooms with a lot of interesting historical content (available in several languages), and you can walk freely around the castle grounds.

### The view from the castle

The Castle of Montju√Øc offers stunning views out over the sea and equally great vistas of the city. For the best experience, it‚Äôs necessary to pay the entrance fee (which is relatively cheap), as you‚Äôll get the best views from the castle walls. You can also walk around the top.

If you don‚Äôt have time to enter the castle, you‚Äôll still get some breathtaking views out over the sea just by walking around the perimeter of the castle walls. There‚Äôs also some great walking to be done in this part of Montju√Øc.



## How to get to the Castle of Montju√Øc

Many tourists choose to take the cable car to Montju√Øc. Keep in mind that **there are two cable cars** and they are not connected at all. This can often confuse a lot of people!


![IMAGE OF THE 2 CABLE CARS HERE](../../assets/blog/15-montjuic-castle/montjuic-castle.jpg)


### Tourist Route 1: Both Cable Cars

Take the ‚Äòtelef√©rico‚Äô (cable car) from Barceloneta, which departs from the [Aeri station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cYT884MU3T5zfWA67). The cable car will drop you off about halfway up Montju√Øc, [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5w8gFUj5P3YZPD8VA) at Pla√ßa de l'Armada and the Gardens (Jardins del Mirador Montju√Øc).

From here, it‚Äôs a [15 to 20 minute walk](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5euGQPcwqwcm1s5p7) up the road. Don‚Äôt miss the [Mirador de Montju√Øc](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Soy4Fyw6Qg5VQdfcA) and the [Mirador de Poble Sec](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HFituTy3oZWe7zadA) too, as well as the [Mirador Swimming Pool](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U89pcr41EQrBX6HM9) (*subject to the swimming pool or the cafe being open in summer/autumn*).

Across the road from the swimming pool, you will see the second cable car station, which is also next door to the funicular station. Take this cable car to the top of Montju√Øc, which drops you off right next to the castle.

- **Summary**: Barceloneta -> 1st Cable Car -> Walk 15 mins -> 2nd Cable Car -> Castle
- **Approx. Price**: Around ‚Ç¨30
- **Price breakdown (as of 2024)**:
  - Cable Car 1: ‚Ç¨12.50 one-way trip.
  - Cable Car 2: ‚Ç¨16 round trip.
  - (optional): Funicular back down to Paral¬∑lel metro station

<div class="warning">

<strong>Tip</strong>: You can also get the Montju√Øc Funicular from Paral¬∑lel metro station to Montju√Øc, if you just want to do the second cable car only ‚Äì‚Äì see route 2 below.

</div>

---

### Tourist Route 2: Funicular + Cable Car

A shorter tourist route would be to take the funicular from Paral¬∑lel metro station (T-Casual tickets can be used) to the top, then simply connect with the [Montju√Øc Cable Car](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rtMj8PTtozYCcF7h7). This is literally next door to the funicular station, so there‚Äôs no uphill walking involved.

- **Summary**: Paral¬∑lel Metro station -> Funicular -> Cable Car -> Castle
- **Approx. Price**: About ‚Ç¨18.40
- **Price breakdown (as of 2024)**:
  - Funicular round trip from Paral¬∑lel metro station: ‚Ç¨1.20 x 2 with T-Mobilitat card
  - Cable Car 2: ‚Ç¨16.00 round trip

---

### Route 3: Walk - Pla√ßa d'Espanya, Palau Nacional + Cable Car

Begin at [Pla√ßa d'Espanya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QqjjXbx59KCs8fxY6) or [Palau Nacional](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7s1nWxaCkmf5CxfP7) (National Palace) and take the walking route round to the left of the National Palace, which eventually takes you to the Montju√Øc Cable Car. Then take the cable car to the top, or walk through the beautiful park and woodland instead.

- **Summary**: Pla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya -> Palau Nacional -> Walk 30 mins -> Cable Car -> Castle
- **Approx. Price**: About ‚Ç¨16.00
- **Price breakdown (as of 2024)**:
  - Cable Car 2: ‚Ç¨16.00 round trip

<div class="success">

<strong>Tip</strong>: Be sure to visit the grand MNAC as you pass.

## Additional Routes

### By bus

The [150 bus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YuhHRdd8zQPVvVec8) route serves Montju√Øc and leaves from Pla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya. Take the bus from here and it‚Äôll drop you close to the castle, requiring only a very short walk to the entrance. The bus is, of course, included in the T-Casual (or equivalent) ticket.


### On foot

It is possible (and recommended) to walk up to the castle from Pobl√© Sec, Pla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya, La Bordeta or Drassanes/Las Ramblas, all of which are popular starting points for most people.

There are several routes from the Poble Sec neighbourhood, all of which include different points of interest along the way. Here are our favourites, but all can be adapted as needed.

In all cases, when walking back down to Barcelona, you can take pretty much any route down, where all roads lead to home!

Continue onto Passeig del Migdia and you have a choice: left, which goes direct to the castle, or right, which takes you past the parking and on to the [Mirador del Migdia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QVByexr9vSYGjEMy9).

Continue up to the hidden bar of [La Caseta del Migdia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X11DfFDpGHGaZG2Y9), stopping off for a drink if it‚Äôs open.

## What‚Äôs nearby the Castle?

During the warmer months, the castle plays host to open-air concerts and gigs inside the castle itself. We highly recommend checking one out, as the venue is very unique. Between June and August, there‚Äôs also [Sala Montju√Øc](https://www.salamontjuic.org), an open-air cinema. The cinema takes place in the grassy area (Fossat de Santa Eul√†lia), and they often kick off the night with a live band before the film starts.

The same lawn is the setting for archery classes, provided by the [Club Arc Montju√Øc](https://www.arcmontjuic.cat/).

The castle also hosts musical events, which are well worth looking into as it‚Äôs an amazing setting for live music.

The intrepid few who don‚Äôt mind the walk will enjoy a trip to the [Mirador del Migdia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tGRySSPcjmMakqEj9) and the hidden bar of [La Caseta del Migdia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wcXqg1cpQTb1zmXb7), which in the summer hosts chilled DJ sessions if you‚Äôre lucky enough to catch them.

Just down the hill from the castle to the north, there‚Äôs also the amazing [Jardins del Mirador](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W23ETLygRhFgQpY39), which is a beautiful garden also with sea views.

In addition to all the above, you can find more information and events via the official Barcelona Ajuntament (council) Montju√Øc page [here](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/castelldemontjuic/en).
