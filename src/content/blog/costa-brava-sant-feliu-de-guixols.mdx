## Visiting Sant Feliu de Guíxols


A little further down the road, you will come to Sant Feliu de Guíxols, which is a small fishing village. The beach is nice but small and there’s only a few restaurants - speaking of which, check out Casa Teva Restaurant, which has a decent Catalan menu with good service. Apart from that, the area can be covered in half a day or less and you might like to pair it up with S’Agaró and Platja de Sant Pol just up the coast (a short car ride away).

Alternatively, I recommend hiking between the two and you’ll get to enjoy the calas en-route, where you’ll see cliff jumping, kayaks and people in the water, as well as the beautiful surrounding nature. It’s a bit up and down again in this area, but unfortunately the price of hidden coves!
