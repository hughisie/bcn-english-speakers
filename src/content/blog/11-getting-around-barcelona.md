## Contents

Barcelona is a big little city, which makes it the kind of place where bands would stop at a world tour, but small enough that you can walk around most of it in a day. Owing to its Mediterranean climate and 2,524 hours of sunshine each year (almost 7 hours per day) walking and cycling is a pleasant experience.

My recommended app for public transport is CityMapper (both Android and iOS) - it covers all of the different options to get around the city, and if you set your Barcelona home location, then it will quickly tell you the best ways to get back using all of the available transport methods. It is not Barcelona-specific and works in a number of other European cities.

The public transport in Barcelona is run by [TMB](https://www.tmb.cat/en/home) (Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona), which is the local authority for public transport. The [TMB website](https://www.tmb.cat/en/home) has route planners and details about the bus, rail, metro and other services (and has some limited English options).

It is nice to walk and cycle to get around, however, there are plenty of other options to get you around the city, from buses to trains to electric motos, to the tram and metro - so let's have a look at each option.

## Walking in Barcelona

As previously mentioned, Barcelona is a great city to walk around - and with walking you can enjoy all of the buildings and scenery without polluting the city, plus it's a chance to absorb some vitamin D!
  
Some of the more distant attractions like Park Güell, Sagrada Familia, Mt. Tibidabo, Montjuïc and the Fòrum might be a bit too far to walk - however you can see most of the central attractions by foot. Barcelona is well catered for pedestrians and has large pavements and other wide streets (“Ramblas”) which allow for you to take in the architecture.

## Cycling in Barcelona

Getting around Barcelona by bike is an excellent experience. The biking infrastructure is getting better and better, with a large network of dedicated bike lanes along with an abundant option of ways to get a bike. Apps like CityMapper or Google Maps show the fastest routes around the city using these lanes and paths, and in my experience, unless it is over a 1 hour walk away, cycling is the best and fastest way to get around.

There are several options to get bikes in Barcelona, and which you choose is dependent on your length of stay and other factors. There are a number of e-bike options as well if you want to get around with less effort (important in the summertime as it is often too hot in the daytime to get anywhere without working up a sweat).

### Bicing

For long term stays, you are best to get [Bicing](https://www.bicing.barcelona/es/) (website in ESP/CAT only), which is the city bikes, administered by the local government (TMB) and has the following prices (updated 2023):

The city has more than 500 Bicing stations; at each station, mechanical and electric bikes are available for rent. You can either use the SMOU application to unlock bikes or they will send you a physical card. To sign up you will need a DNI or NIE/TIE and the system is intended for residents only.

The SMOU app works reasonably well on both Android and iOS and also allows you to reserve a bike for 5 mins. If the station at your destination is full you can get an additional 10 mins for free to find another space. CityMapper works well with Bicing to show you local stations’ availability and also the availability at your destination.

I use Bicing most days as a resident and it is usually the best way to get around for anything that is more than a 10-15 minute walk.

### Bike Rental

You have a number of places offering bike rental in Barcelona, the prices are very reasonable and the bikes are usually well maintained. You have a number of traditional stores dotted around the city, and prices usually go from €5 per hour to around €30 per day, depending on the type of bike you hire.

There are also a number of app based transportation solutions that offer bikes, or eBikes on a per minute basis, these include:

[Cooltra](https://cooltra.com/en/rent-by-minutes-hours/) offers e-bikes and electric motos around the city, their app is available on iOS/Android and is available in English, and you get charged by the minute. (need to check prices)

[Yego](https://en.rideyego.com/how-it-works/barcelona) offers e-bikes and electric scooters in a jaunty green colour. Yego also offers e-bikes, which can be found and unlocked using their app.

[Donkey Republic](https://www.donkey.bike/cities/bike-rental-barcelona/) also has a large number of bikes dotted around the city and their app is available in English. They offer rentals by the day (€16) but start from as little as €1,70 for 15 minutes. Their full pricing system is available in the app. Donkey Republic is not just in Barcelona so if you have a membership in your home city then you will be able to use the bike system here, too.

[Kleta](https://www.kleta.com) offers bike rental by the month in Barcelona for both mechanical and eBikes, with prices starting from <€20 per month based on a mechanical bike for a 12 month subscription.

[RideMovi](https://www.ridemovi.com) is another app based solution for bikes and eBikes.

## Public Transport

The city has a well-developed public transportation network that includes buses, trams, and a funicular railway. The public transportation system in Barcelona is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) and is integrated with the metro, allowing passengers to use the same tickets and passes on all modes of transportation.

The bus network in Barcelona covers the entire city and its suburbs, with over 140 bus lines. Many of the bus lines run 24 hours a day, making them a convenient option for getting around at night.

The tram network in Barcelona consists of four lines that serve the city centre and the suburbs. Trams are a popular option for tourists as they offer a scenic way to see the city, with many of the tram routes passing through popular landmarks and neighbourhoods.

The funicular railway in Barcelona connects the city centre with the Montjuïc hill, providing access to popular attractions such as the Montjuïc Castle and the Poble Espanyol.

In addition to the metro, bus, tram, and funicular railway, the city of Barcelona also has several suburban railways that serve the metropolitan area. These include the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and the Renfe (Spanish National Railways).

### Metro

The Barcelona [metro](https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona-transport/map/metro) is a rapid transit system that serves the city of Barcelona and its metropolitan area in Spain. It is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) and is one of the busiest and most extensive metro systems in Europe. A single ticket is €2.40 and is valid for 30 mins (from first entrance usage).

The Barcelona metro system consists of eight lines that are colour-coded for easy identification, and you can find a map [here](https://www.tmb.cat/documents/20182/96078/Plànol+xarxa+de+Metro/f5578f40-5a66-46ba-907c-cf31e0d368c0). The lines are:

Overall, the public transportation system in Barcelona is comprehensive and efficient, making it easy for visitors and residents to get around the city and its surroundings.

*   L1 (Red)
*   L2 (Purple)
*   L3 (Green)
*   L4 (Yellow)
*   L5 (Blue)
*   L9 (Orange)
*   L10 (Light Blue)
*   L11 (Light Green)

The metro lines serve the city centre as well as the suburbs, with stops at major landmarks and attractions such as the Sagrada Família, Park Güell, and the beach. The metro runs from around 5:00 am to midnight, with trains arriving at stations every few minutes during peak hours.

In addition to the metro, the city of Barcelona also has a network of buses, trams, and a funicular railway that connects the city centre with the Montjuïc hill. There are also several suburban railways that serve the metropolitan area.

Overall, the Barcelona metro is a convenient and efficient way to get around the city and its surroundings.

### Bus

The [bus network](https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona/buses/lines) in Barcelona is a comprehensive and efficient system that serves the city and its suburbs. It is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) and is integrated with the metro, allowing passengers to use the same tickets and passes on both modes of transportation. A single ticket is €2.40 if you don't have a pass and the buses accept cash and contactless payment.

There are over 140 bus lines in the Barcelona bus network, with many of the lines running 24 hours a day. The bus lines serve all areas of the city and its suburbs, with stops at major landmarks and attractions such as the Sagrada Família, Park Güell, and the beach.

The buses in Barcelona are modern and comfortable, with many of them equipped with air conditioning and low floors for easy accessibility. Most of the buses also have free Wi-Fi, making them a convenient option for travellers who need to stay connected while on the go.

In addition to the regular bus lines, Barcelona also has a network of tourist buses that offer hop-on, hop-off services. These buses are a popular option for tourists as they allow passengers to see the city at their own pace and visit the main landmarks and attractions.

Overall, the Barcelona bus network is a convenient and efficient way to get around the city and its surroundings.

### Tram

The [tram](https://www.tram.cat/en) is probably the method I use in Barcelona, the least - but it serves its purpose on occasions and is a quite cool way to travel. Right now there are two main lines and they are not connected - but there are plans to join them in the next few years. You can find a [map of the tram network here](https://www.tram.cat/cms/media/3290/atm_glob_octubre_2021.pdf) .

It is useful if you are at an event at Port Forum (like Primavera sound) and need to get back to one of the main stations (like Plaça Glories), and you can use any transport card to get around on them. A single ticket, like the Bus, Metro and Trains in zone one is €2.40.

### Motos

One of the things I love about Barcelona is the ease of getting around the city. This has been made even easier due to the abundance of eMotos which are pretty much available in most places at most times, and work out a cost effective way of getting around the city (more so if there are two of you). You download the app, send them a copy of your driving licence for validation, and then find a bike and get your helmets and go! Just be mindful there are zones where these biomes are allowed, these cover most of the city, but please check beforehand.

You can park a moto in a few different places in Barcelona, but it's always best in a designated space as you don't want to get a ticket. Parking is possible on pavements and other areas, but it's not so cut and dry in my opinion - so much so that they have a pdf you can check all the [rules here](https://www.areaverda.cat/sites/default/files/fitxer_estatic/Flyer-motos-voreres-eng-interactiu.pdf) .

There are a number of companies that offer the service, new ones come and go all the time - so here is my pick of them. Note these are all my own affiliate links and you get some free minutes/credit for using them, which is better than just signing up (however it's not hard to remove it so feel free to do so if you like).

Most of them work out between 25c-30c per minute, but it's worth buying minute bundles if you are staying in Barcelona for some time.

[Acciona](https://acciona-motosharing.onelink.me/8HVM/e50d02fb) - My favourite, the bikes are fast and there are a lot of them. Some good offers for minute packs and the bikes themselves are well built.

[Cooltra](https://cooltra.com/) - functional bikes, not really very fast (which is mostly fine) and some good offers for minute packs at various times of the year.

[Yego](https://www.yego.mobi/deeplink/coupon/CDBIIGHGDP) - jaunty green bikes, slow, but comfortable and just about get the job done (and each bike has its own name, which is unique). Tip: Never go as a two and try to get up the hills in Gracia, you will be faster walking.

### Electric Scooters

By these I mean the things that you stand up on and have an electric motor. There are a couple of options in Barcelona where you have an app to activate them, and you can also hire these for an hour or longer at most of the bike rental stores.

### Taxis

I am not a fan of taxis in Barcelona, I have been overcharged many times when they realised that I am a foreigner, and some are not very clean, but compared to other cities they are not bad value if they are not trying to get more money out of you. If you have to get a taxi, it is worth knowing the following:

*   Airport taxis are somewhat fixed prices, costing around €35 from T1 to Placa Catalunya and readily available at the airport.
*   If you need a taxi, you can use the app Free Now, it's like a not so good Uber but the drivers get reviewed and the route they are taking is clear and you have a fixed charge or can do it by the meter. There is also no surge pricing, and it uses the existing Barcelona network of taxis. You can also use the app to pre-book at certain hours. In general it works really well.
*   Uber is in Barcelona, but in a limited capacity and it makes it quite useless as there are just not enough cars right now. Don't expect this to change any time soon as the taxi drivers just protest and then protest some more until they get their own way (and block the streets and attack rival drivers but that's another story).
*   Cabify is like the Uber of Barcelona, the cars are modern and clean and the entire service is very professional. Highly recommended, but you need to have the app for a certain amount of time before you can use it (because, well taxi drivers protested…) so get it installed before you travel.

### Train

There is a rail network that goes out of most directions in Barcelona, mostly it is not useful because the metro is much better and the trains are infrequent, however there are some exceptions. There is a direct train that goes from Passeig de Gracia and Sants that terminates at the airport (Terminal 2), and you can use your T-Casual to get to the airport. They are only once every 30 mins, but this is easily enough to plan around - and takes about 30 mins to get to the airport. 

Tickets are cheap compared to other cities and you can go and visit some cool neighbouring towns to get a quieter beach during the summer.

There is also a ski train that offers both a ski pass and transport to the closest resort and costs about €45 and goes from Plaça d'Espanya.

Most trains in Barcelona go into Sants (like to Madrid), with some regional ones going into Estacio De Franca, Estacion Nord and Plaça d'Espanya.
