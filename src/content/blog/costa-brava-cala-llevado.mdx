## Visiting Cala Llevadó

Although strictly not a town, Cala Llevadó gets a mention due to having a large camping zone and a secluded “cala” bay and beach, which is the closest beach if you're staying at the campsite. The campsite itself can be reached by public transport (train to Blanes, followed by a local bus from Blanes station to outside the campsite). The campsite itself is set on a hill in the forest and there are different types of lodgings to choose from, from alpine chateaus to camping in tents. Here's a link to [Camping Llevado](https://calallevado.com/) if you want to read more.

It's worth a trip down to the beach if you're in the area and you'll find it very secluded and quiet but it's a steep descent. It is also possible (and very nice) to do a day walk from the camping area to Tossa de Mar, via a forest/coastal path, so be sure to check [Wikilok](https://www.wikiloc.com/) or [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) for an appropriate route.
